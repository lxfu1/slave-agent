## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Hardened terminal rendering against untrusted control sequences, including OSC clipboard commands.
- Enforced canonical filesystem boundaries for file listing, code search, reads, writes, and edits.
- Made dangerous-command confirmation override explicit allow rules and fully enforced disabled tools.
- Corrected streaming usage accounting, cancellation propagation, session restoration, task failure handling, and context-budget estimation.
- Tolerated OpenAI-compatible gateways that close the transport immediately after sending an explicit streaming finish reason.
- Made graceful shutdown cancel in-flight automatic note updates instead of waiting for the full model timeout.
- Fixed queued-input leakage, multi-line paste submission, Unicode cursor editing, narrow-terminal status layout, and code highlighting overlap.
- Added regression tests and made the complete test suite part of the publish gate.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **`/plan <goal>` — Plan-Execute-Reflect (PER) agentic loop** — Breaks a goal into tasks (planning phase), executes each in dependency order (execution phase), then reflects on results with read-only tools. Progress is streamed to the UI with per-task start/done notices.
- **Task persistence** — Tasks are now stored in SQLite (`tasks` table), scoped to the session, and survive `/resume`. Dependency ordering uses Kahn's topological sort; tasks with unresolved `blockedBy` are deferred until their predecessors complete.
- **`WebSearch` tool** — Queries Brave Search and returns ranked titles, URLs, and snippets. Always registered; returns a clear error if `search.apiKey` is not configured. Requires `search.provider: brave` and `search.apiKey` in `config.yaml`.
- **Tool result cache** — Read-only tool results are cached in-memory with a 30-second TTL, keyed on tool name + serialised input. The cache is cleared automatically when any file-mutating tool (`WriteFile`, `EditFile`, `WriteNotes`) succeeds.
- **RunCommand sandbox** — When `permissions.sandbox.enabled: true`, child processes inherit only the env vars listed in `permissions.sandbox.allowedEnvVars` (default: `PATH HOME LANG TERM USER SHELL TZ`). Sensitive keys such as `MODEL_API_KEY` are never visible to spawned commands.

### Changed

- `ToolContext` now carries a `config: MemoAgentConfig` field — tools can read the full agent configuration without coupling to the engine.
- `CreateTask` / `UpdateTask` / `ListTasks` / `GetTask` now read and write through SQLite instead of an in-memory Map; task state is preserved across `/resume`.

### Configuration additions

```yaml
# Brave Search integration (optional)
search:
  provider: brave
  api_key: "${BRAVE_API_KEY}"
  max_results: 5

permissions:
  # ... existing fields ...
  sandbox:
    enabled: false              # Set true to filter child-process env
    allowed_env_vars:
      - PATH
      - HOME
      - LANG
      - TERM
      - USER
      - SHELL
      - TZ
```

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Persistent memory** — `NOTES.md` is injected into every system prompt; `auto_update: true` extracts and saves facts automatically after each turn
- **Session chain archiving** — context compression creates a new session linked via `parent_session_id`, so full history is always recoverable
- **Three-zone context compression** — HEAD (anchor), MIDDLE (archived summary), TAIL (~20k tokens live context); auto-triggers at 85% usage
- **Slash command system** — `/help`, `/notes`, `/history`, `/search`, `/compact`, `/cost`, `/clear`, `/resume`, `/model`, `/profile`, `/recipes`, `/mode`, `/exit`
- **Recipes system** — reusable `.md` prompt templates with `allowedTools` pre-approval and `watchPaths` auto-recommendation
- **MCP tool extensions** — connect external tool servers via Model Context Protocol; tools namespaced as `mcp__server__tool`
- **Built-in tool set** — `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, `EditFile`, `ListFiles`, `SearchCode`, `RunCommand`, `WriteNotes`, `ReadNotes`, `CreateTask`, `UpdateTask`, `ListTasks`, `GetTask`, `SearchHistory`, `ListSessions`
- **Permission guard** — `ask`/`auto` modes; dangerous command blocklist always enforced; safe project directory auto-approval; per-tool disable via `disabledTools`
- **Profile isolation** — independent config, memory, sessions, and recipes per profile (`--profile <name>`)
- **Rich terminal UI** — React + Ink rendering, streaming output, real-time token/cost status bar, cursor positioning, command history
- **YAML config with snake_case support** — `config.yaml` accepts both `snake_case` and `camelCase` field names
- **Session persistence** — SQLite with WAL mode and FTS5 full-text search; `/resume` works in-session and via `--resume` flag
- **Auxiliary model support** — separate cheaper model for context compression via `AUX_*` env vars or config

### Security

- Path traversal protection on `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, `EditFile` (cwd + profileDir boundary)
- Prompt injection scanning on `NOTES.md`, `PROFILE.md`, and recipe files before injection
- FTS5 query escaping to prevent syntax injection
- `WriteFile` content size limit (10 MB)
